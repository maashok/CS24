a)

For a 3 GHz : 1 clock = 0.3 ns

Hit time = 1 clock
Miss penalty = 100 clocks

(1 - miss rate) * 1 clock + (miss rate) * 100 clocks = # clocks/access

750 million data accesses per second
= 750 million/10^9 data accesses per nanosecond
= 750 x 10^6 / 10^9 * 0.3 data accesses per clock
= .225 data accesses per clock

0.225 data accesses are done per clock, or each data acccess
gets 1/0.225 = 4.444 clocks per data access.
Plugging back in,

4.444 clocks per data access = 1 - m + 100m = 99m + 1

m = 0.0348

There is a miss rate of 3.48%

b)

If you double the performance (instructions per second), since each
instruction needs 1 data value, you also end up the number
of data accesses per second, and the number of data accesses per
clock.

Thus, the number of clocks per data access is halved, to
2.222 clocks per data access. Plugging back in again,

2.222 clocks per data access = 99m + 1

m = 0.0123

So, the miss rate should be 1.23%

So you should reduce the cache miss rate by about 65% of the
current miss rate, reducing the miss rate from 3.48% to 1.23%.
