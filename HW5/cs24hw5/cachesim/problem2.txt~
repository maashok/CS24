Constructing memory for simulation (in reverse order):
 * Building memory of size 4000000 bytes
 * Building cache with a block-size of 32 bytes, 256 cache-sets,
   and 1 cache-lines per set.  Total cache size is 8192 bytes.

Generating 1000000 random floats to sort.
Sorting numbers using the heap.
Checking the results against the sorted inputs.

Memory-Access Statistics:

 * Cache reads=387851976 writes=156711356 hits=531488886 misses=13074446 
   miss-rate=2.40% random replacement policy
 * Memory reads=418382272 writes=334897760
