The program has to cut itself off after reaching max execute time, hinting
that there is an infinite loop in the program. This is because the remainder
must steadily decrease (from the dividend) while the quotient increases from 0, until
the remainder becomes negative. The remainder is changed by subtracting the
divisor from it each time quotient is incremented (one more of divisor can go
into dividend). However, if the divisor is zero, each time in our loop, the
remainder is set to the same value and will never become less than zero to
break out of the loop. Thus, an infinite loop results, with quotient
continuously being incremented and remainder staying 10 at all times. This 
technically makes sense since 10/0 is infinity, and the quotient is
being incremented towards infinity in this case.
