Part 1

IF LIST IS EMPTY
   RETURN ADDRESS

FIRST = HEAD
SECOND = HEAD->next

HEAD->next = NULL

WHILE TRUE:
   SAVE SECOND->next
   SECOND->next = FIRST

   FIRST = SECOND
   SECOND = saved SECOND->next

   IF (SECOND == TAIL)
      BREAK
   END IF

END WHILE

SWAP HEAD, TAIL


Part 2

head = list->head;
tail = list->tail;

t = (head == NULL);
if (t)
   goto Return;

t = (tail == NULL);
if (t)
   goto Return;

first = head;
second = first->next;

head->next = NULL;

Loop:
   temp = second->next;
   second->next = first;

   first = second;
   second = temp;

   t = (second == tail);
   if (!t)
      goto Loop;

Done:
   list->tail = head;
   list->head = tail;

Return:
   return
