Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?
You can detect when a page is accessed by setting the access
permissions to PROT_NONE using mprotect. Then, when any
access is made, a fault is raised and go to the signal handler.
In the fault handler, we can then look at the page and know
that it should not have faulted because it is in virtual
memory already. Thus, we know that the page must have been
accessed (This only tells us the first time). Then, we
can give the page permission to read.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?
Similarly, you can detect when a page is accessed by
setting the access permissions to PROT__READ. Thus, writes
to the region will cause a segfault. Then, the fault handler
will analyze this and know that a segfault should not have
occurred since the page is in memory, and that it instead
signfies that the page is dirty. Then, the page is given
permission to write as well.

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:
51,923

g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement: FIFO

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  47,944

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement:  Clock/LRU

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:  6,833

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.
